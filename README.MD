# Web-Clothing

Project Based on Udemy's Course [Complete React Developer in 2019](https://www.udemy.com/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) by *Andrei Neagoie*, *Yihua Zhang*.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Frameworks

The App was developed with React, Redux, Firebase, Firestore and Stripe, besides some other Frameworks.

This is the final version, but in the Course, we did many different implementations. Hooks instead of Redux, GraphQL and many more.
